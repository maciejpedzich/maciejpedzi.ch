Hey folks!

For this article, I've actually made notes from a different book, ie. _Linux - komendy i polecenia (commands and instructions)_ by ≈Åukasz Sosna. THis time I'll cover the _practical part_, ie. Bash language's syntax and sample code snippets.

As always, these are just key takeaways, so if you're aiming to squeeze out every bit of knowledge possible, then I highly recommend you buy this and Michael Hausenblas' book.
